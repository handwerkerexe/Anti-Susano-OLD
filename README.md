# FiveM Susano Detection

## 📖 Description
This repository contains a **FiveM detection** that was developed in the past to detect the **Susano cheat**.  
At the time of development, the detection worked reliably, but it is **no longer up to date** and does not detect current versions of the cheat anymore.

This project is mainly intended for:
- **Learning and research purposes**
- **Reference material** for implementing cheat detections in FiveM
- **Historical documentation** of older anti-cheat approaches

---

## ⚠️ Project Status
❌ **Inactive / Outdated**

- The detection is **no longer maintained**
- The Susano cheat has changed significantly since then
- No guarantee of functionality on current FiveM versions

---

## 📂 Usage
This code is **not recommended for production use**.  
Feel free to review, study, or adapt parts of the detection for educational purposes.
